Computer Science III : Assignment #2

Second assignment completed for Computer Science III course at Franklin & Marshall College.

This assignment first pushes the student to create a basic recursive algorithm (computing the powers of numbers) along with the sum of the result's digits. Using the 
functions needed for this assignment, the student then has to come up with an algorithm that breaks a list of numbers into M continuous, non-empty sub-lists such that 
the largest sum_vector(sub-list) for all the sub-lists is minimal.
